/*
   strm provides the memory allocation functions and window buffer on input,
   and provides information on the unused input on return.  For Z_DATA_ERROR
   returns, strm will also provide an error message.

   in() and out() are the call-back input and output functions.  When
   inflateBack() needs more input, it calls in().  When inflateBack() has
   filled the window with output, or when it completes with data in the
   window, it calls out() to write out the data.  The application must not
   change the provided input until in() is called again or inflateBack()
   returns.  The application must not change the window/output buffer until
   inflateBack() returns.

   in() and out() are called with a descriptor parameter provided in the
   inflateBack() call.  This parameter can be a structure that provides the
   information required to do the read or write, as well as accumulated
   information on the input and output such as totals and check values.

   in() should return zero on failure.  out() should return non-zero on
   failure.  If either in() or out() fails, than inflateBack() returns a
   Z_BUF_ERROR.  strm->next_in can be checked for Z_NULL to see whether it
   was in() or out() that caused in the error.  Otherwise,  inflateBack()
   returns Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_DATA_ERROR for an deflate format
   error, or Z_MEM_ERROR if it could not allocate memory for the state.
   inflateBack() can also return Z_STREAM_ERROR if the input parameters
   are not correct, i.e. strm is Z_NULL or the state was not initialized.
